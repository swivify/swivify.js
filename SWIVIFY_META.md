# Swivify Project Meta Data

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Done

- Monorepo migrated to ESM-first, TypeScript, and modular structure
- All major templates (REST, GraphQL, Fastify, Prisma, Auth, File Upload, Fullstack) created and documented
- CLI supports interactive project, DB, and feature selection
- Inspector Dashboard implemented with live API health, logs, module graph, error overlays, and middleware snippets
- Plugin system expanded with lifecycle hooks, config validation, and official plugins (TypeScript, Prisma, GraphQL, Fastify, Auth, Env)
- Recipe/integration CLI and official recipes (Docker, CI/CD, cloud) provided
- Example projects (advanced, real-world, SSR, monorepo) scaffolded
- Advanced DX features: HMR/live reload, SSR/middleware helpers, plugin registry, CLI auto-completion
- Security best practices, advanced guides, and VSCode extension docs written
- VitePress documentation fully enriched, matching Vite‚Äôs quality
- All roadmap items up to date and checked off

## üü° What‚Äôs To Be Done (Immediate Next Steps)

- Comprehensive testing of all code, templates, plugins, and documentation
- Document and fix any issues found during testing
- Update documentation and code as needed based on test results

## üîÆ Future Directions

- Gather user/contributor feedback for further improvements
- Expand the plugin and template ecosystem (community contributions, registry/marketplace)
- Enhance Inspector Dashboard with more analytics and customization
- Develop and publish the actual VSCode extension (beyond docs)
- Explore advanced HMR/stateful reload and SSR integrations
- Add more real-world example projects and advanced recipes
- Continue to refine DX, security, and performance based on real-world usage
- Monitor and update dependencies, security, and best practices regularly

## üìù Tomorrow‚Äôs Plan

1. Systematically test every part of the codebase and documentation.
2. Log and address any issues or gaps.
3. Only after all tests pass, move on to new features or tasks.
